Reviews: 

"Harrod & Funck are among the hottest acts on the local folk scene . . . [they] have built their careers quite literally from the underground up; singing in subway stops on the Red Line, on bustling corners in Harvard Square and Faneuil Hall . . . Tourists may think they are some sort of quaint Boston novelty, but fans of Boston's burgeoning young songwriter scene recognize at once that these are serious players." 
***—The Boston Globe***

"They play acoustic music highlighted with tight, inventive harmonies. Like the best artists, they create a sound all their own." 
***—Performing Songwriter Magazine***

"Not since Simon & Garfunkel has an acoustic duo stirred me as powerfully as Harrod & Funck." 
***—Metronome Magazine***

"A hush fell over the subway station while they sang." 
***—Boston Magazine***

"*Live* is ultimately the most successful Harrod & Funck CD at demonstrating why the two worked so well together . . . something special happened when these two talented guitarists played in a room together."
