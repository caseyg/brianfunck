Synopsis: What happens when prisoners convicted of first-degree murder as teenagers are given the chance to re-enter society? *Second Chance Kids* looks at the fight over the fate of some 2,000 individuals following a landmark 2012 Supreme CourtÂ ruling that found mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles unconstitutional. With unique access, FRONTLINE follows the cases of two of the first men to be released in the wake of the ruling.
