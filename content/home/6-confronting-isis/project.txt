Reviews: 

“It’s the kind of objective, distanced yet personal reporting FRONTLINE has earned a well-deserved reputation for. *[Confronting ISIS]* maps out in simple — but not simple-minded — terms what’s at stake, how we got here, where we go from here, and why it matters.” 
**—Alex Strachan, *T.V. Worth Watching***

“As the PBS FRONTLINE documentary presents exceptionally well, while politicians have grappled with the best course of action and attempted to implement halfheartedly conceived plans, cities in wide swaths of Syria and Iraq have been turned to rubble. . .With *Confronting ISIS*, FRONTLINE gives viewers a first-hand look at what is faced by whoever becomes commander-in-chief in November."  
**—Scott Hough, *Inquisitr***
