Synopsis: How small can we go? Could we one day have robots taking "fantastic voyages" in our bodies to kill rogue cells? The triumphs of tiny are seen all around us in the Information Age: transistors, microchips, laptops, cell phones. Now, David Pogue takes NOVA viewers to an even smaller world in *Making Stuff: Smaller*, examining the latest in high-powered nano-circuits and micro-robots that may one day hold the key to saving lives.Â
