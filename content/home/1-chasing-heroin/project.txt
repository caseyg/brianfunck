Reviews: 

“*Chasing Heroin* is painfully important TV...you walk away from *Chasing Heroin* not depressed, but invigorated – engaged – by the efforts being made by valiant people to help stem the tide of this dreadful situation.” 
**—Ken Tucker, *Yahoo TV***

“Shows what a humane approach to addiction actually looks like...disappointments and setbacks are frequent in *Chasing Heroin*. It's because of these disappointments that the film achieves a clear-eyed, even vital importance, especially if you know someone struggling with addiction."  
**—Jason Cherkis, *The Huffington Post***

“*Chasing Heroin* is a searing two-hour look at what the heroin “epidemic” means.”  
**—John Doyle, *The Globe and Mail***

“A penetrating, harrowing look at addicts struggling free from drugs and a criminal justice system struggling free from a destructive, zero-tolerance past.”  
**—Casey Jaywork, *The Seattle Weekly***

Synopsis: A searing, two-hour investigation places America’s heroin crisis in a fresh and provocative light -- telling the stories of individual addicts, but also illuminating the epidemic's years-in-the-making social context, deeply examining shifts in U.S. drug policy, and exploring what happens when addiction is treated like a public health issue, not a crime.
