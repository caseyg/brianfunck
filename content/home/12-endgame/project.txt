Reviews: 

“Covers a remarkable amount of territory in its two hours, managing to touch upon the topics of health, history, culture, race, and gender using real people to illustrate a massive problem.”
**—Claire Zulkey, *A.V. Club***

Synopsis: Every 10 minutes, someone in the U.S. contracts HIV. Half are black. Thirty years after the discovery of the AIDS virus among gay white men, nearly half of the one million people in the United States infected with HIV are black men, women and children. A FRONTLINE special presentation, *ENDGAME: AIDS in Black America,* is a groundbreaking two-hour exploration of one of the country's most urgent, preventable health crises.
