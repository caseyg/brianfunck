Reviews: 

“As pure storytelling, *Bitter Rivals* is gripping stuff. It’s tightly edited, eye-filling and yet thoughtful, fast-paced, pensive and reflective. If John le Carré were to write a two-part, three-hour TV documentary about sectarian tensions on the Arabian Peninsula, it would look a lot like this. There are betrayals and broken confidences. Bitter Rivals is complex, and yet disarmingly simple when one least expects.”
**—Alex Strachan, *T.V. Worth Watching***

Synopsis: FRONTLINE tells the epic, inside story of how a dangerous feud between Iran and Saudi Arabia has plunged the Middle East into unprecedented levels of violence - with exclusive, on-the-ground reporting from inside both countries as well as Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and Lebanon.
