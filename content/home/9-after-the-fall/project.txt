Synopsis: In 1989, as communism fell across Eastern Europe, doctors and nurses in Romania discovered they were dealing with an epidemic of pediatric AIDS in their hospitals and institutions. *After the Fall: HIV Grows Up* reveals what happened: the complicated history, the caregivers' response, and the issues and challenges the survivors now face as they come of age. The film shares an intimate portrait of a group of Romanian young adults living with HIV and their efforts to integrate into society, marry, have families and embark on successful careers. They are heroes with inspiring stories that demonstrate triumph in the face of remarkable challenges.
