Reviews: 

“A thrilling detective story, a wrenching tale of loss, a rare inside look at a chaotic turning point in history…*My Brother’s Bomber* is an extraordinary documentary experience.” 
**—Peter Keough, *The Boston Globe***

“On premise alone, *My Brother’s Bomber* is compelling. In practice, it’s even more so...[it] has the sensibility of going down a rabbit hole. The cinematography is superb—choppy, layered and of varying fidelity, as cameras go into homes or film from vehicles. The effect mimics Dornstein’s lifelong effort to sift through the layers of evidence to find what might be the essential truth of David’s death.”  
**—Sonia Saraiya, *Salon***

Synopsis: For some 25 years, filmmaker Ken Dornstein has been haunted by the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland – a terrorist act that killed 270 people, including his older brother David. Now, in this emotional and suspenseful three-part serial, Dornstein sets out to find the men responsible for one of the worst attacks on Americans before 9/11. From the ruins and chaos of post-Qaddafi Libya, Dornstein hunts for clues to the identities and whereabouts of the suspects, whom he tracks for almost five years across the Middle East and Europe. With each episode, Dornstein encounters new witnesses and unearths fresh evidence that brings him closer to the truth about what really happened. My Brother's Bomber is a rare, real-life spy thriller, but also a timely reflection on the legacy of America's long war on terror and a lyrical meditation on loss, love, revenge, and the nature of obsession.
