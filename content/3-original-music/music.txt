Reviews: 

"They play acoustic music highlighted with tight, inventive harmonies. Like the best artists, they create a sound all their own." ***—Performing Songwriter Magazine***

"This overlooked CD deserves another listen. Dusky atmosphere like the Blue Nile…it ranges from Dylanesque folk with harmonica to rippling guitar." ***—The Boston Globe***

"Not since Simon & Garfunkel has an acoustic duo stirred me as powerfully as Harrod and Funck." ***—Metronome Magazine***

"A hush fell over the subway station while they sang." ***—Boston Magazine***

"Live is ultimately the most successful Harrod and Funck CD at demonstrating why the two worked so well together…something special happened when these two talented guitarists played in a room together." ***—allmusic.com***
